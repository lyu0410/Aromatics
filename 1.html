  <h2>Polymerization</h2>
  <p>
    In polymer chemistry, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/polymerization" target="_blank" title="polymerization specification">polymerization</a> is a process of <strong>reacting <u>monomer</u> molecules</strong> together in a chemical reaction to form polymer chains or three-dimensional networks.

    In chemical compounds, polymerization can occur via a variety of reaction mechanisms that vary in complexity due to the functional groups present in the reactants and their inherent steric effects. In more straightforward polymerizations, alkenes form polymers through relatively simple radical reactions; in contrast, reactions involving substitution at a carbonyl group require more complex synthesis due to the way in which reactants polymerize. Alkanes can also be polymerized, but only with the help of strong acids.
